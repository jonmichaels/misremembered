Misremembered is possibly the brain-child of me, Jon Michaels, a long-time sound editor, maker of tacos, and generally tech-minded fellow. I currently reside in Marshfield, MA with my wife, two children, two cats, a dog, and numerous fish.

When not busy cleaning up after my offspring and the animals in my life, I enjoy tabletop boardgames and roleplaying games, [genealogy research](/about/ancestors.html), reading, and watching movies.

## Current Activities

For years I've hacked together AppleScripts and macros to make my computer life and in particular my work easier. Recently I decided to try to up my game and actually learn proper computer programming. I am working my way through an in-depth course on SwiftUI.

My elementary-school-age kids enjoy Minecraft. It's probably safe to say that my oldest is obsessed with it. This year I set up an in-house cross platform Java and Bedrock Minecraft server for us (mostly them) to play around on. We've been slowly shaping our world together.

## This Website

The site was created using the [Eleventy Excellent](https://github.com/madrilene/eleventy-excellent) starter by [Lene Saile](https://www.lenesaile.com/en/). I use the [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev) static site generator to create the pages, push them to GitHub, and from there host it on [Netlify](https://netlify.com).
