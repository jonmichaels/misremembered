Through my genealogy research I have been able to confirm a few of my famous ancestors.

Mark Twain (Samuel Clemens), Author
(1835 - 1910)
4th cousin 4x removed

{% imagePlaceholder "./src/assets/images/05_james_monroe_400.jpg", "A headshot of the president, James Monroe" %}

James Monroe, 5th President of the United States
(1758 - 1831)
1st cousin 7x removed

Family Search claims that President Abraham Lincoln is my 6th cousin 5x removed, and that the actress Shirley Temple is my 7th cousin 3x removed. I haven't been able to verify that myself yet. Still researching.
